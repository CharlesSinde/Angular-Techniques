<h1>First Child route page!</h1>
<h2>I am using a different router module which is attached to child-ex.module.ts</h2>
<h2>app.module imports ChildExModule before AppRoutingModule</h2>
<h2>Q: Why use seperate routers per module?</h2>
<h2>A: If you are importing a lot of feature from a module, it is easier to use their own router with the hooekd in routes,
  rather than having to constantly add the new routes to app-routing.module.(or remove)
</h2>
